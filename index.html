<h2>Computing Degree Show 2022</h2>

<p>Welcome to the Degree Show website for the 2022 Computing Degree Show. On this site you will find information on all of the projects that are being presented this year. Honours projects at Dundee are the equivalent of a 600 hour piece of work that all students are expected to carry out as part of their final year.</p>

        <p>The aim of the Computing Honours Project is to give student experience in carrying out an independent software development project which is the culmination of their study in Computing and relevant to your future career plans.</p>

        <p>Students are fully responsible for the technical aspects and day-to-day management of their project. Supervisors provide guidance and advice and to monitor your progress but act more of coach to assist students in carrying out their best work.</p>
