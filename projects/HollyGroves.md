## Project Description
Climate change is a problem for everyone. In order the help the environment, everyone should be doing what they can to reduce their carbon footprint. An ideal way for an individual to do so is reducing the amount of energy they consume, however not everyone has the knowledge of how this can be done.

Amazon’s Alexa devices are in people’s homes, where they consume their energy, and are part of the user’s every-day life. This creates a chance for an Alexa skill to provide energy-saving tips and persuade the users to act on the recommendations given.

The aim of the project is to develop such skill by researching into persuasive techniques voice use interfaces can use. The skill will also store information provided by the user on their energy consumption to assist the feedback given.

## Project Findings
### Research
Research was conducted into three areas before development began, these areas were; eco feedback, voice user interfaces and persuasive technology.
- Eco Feedback: 
- Voice User Interfaces: 
- Persuasive Technology:

### Development
The Alexa skill developed, entitiled 'Energy Log', provides the following functionalities/information to encourage energy-saving practices. Each bulletpoint represents an intent within the Alexa skill:

- Adding appliances: this allows users to add appliances they have used to the skill, to keep track of where and when their energy is being consumed. Currently, it is only possible to add a limitted number of different appliances to the skill. In future, with the use of smart technology, this can be avoiding by appliances automatically providing their energy usage and when they were used to the skill.

- Total energy usage: the total energy usage, which is calculated based off of user information proivded to the skill along with average energy consumptions, can be provided by day, week, month or year. Total energy usage is presented as a cost, rather than more technical kilowatt hours, simillar to a smart metre.

- Energy usage for specific appliances: similar to total energy usage, the energy usage for a specific appliance can be provided using the user inputted information and average energy consumptions. This is also presented as a cost and can be provided by day, week, month or year.

- Appliance with the highest usage:

- When the peak energy usage occurs:

- Comparison between different time frames:

- Provide recommendations:

- Add user specific energy tariff:

- Add user specific time zone:
