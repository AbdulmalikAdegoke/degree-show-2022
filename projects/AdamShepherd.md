## Project Description
The aim of this project is to develop an online learning and collaboration platform for the company PBSuk. PBSuk specialise in helping people with complex needs and one of the things they do is provide a series of training programmes for Positive Behavioural Support (PBS) practitioners. The problem they are currently facing is that they have no easy or accessible way in which to share additional resources and videos with practitioners, or a way for practitioners to communicate and interact with each other. The aim of this project is to provide them with a solution to this problem.

Throughout this project, Adam has be engaged with the client to undergo a full Agile Software Development Cycle in order to gather requirements, design, develop and test a website that will be launched to provide a platform for PBS practitioners to access supporting material, additional training videos and a forum where they can communicate with other practitioners. The platform will consist of two main areas:

- Resource Hub - This will be a collection of additional resources to support the already existing training courses that PBSuk provides. Here, practitioners will find additional training videos, supplementary documents and any other useful resources to aid their learning.
- Forum - This will provide a space where practitioners can interact with each other, ask for advice and share any help or experience they may have.
