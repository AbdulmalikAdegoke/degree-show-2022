## Project Description
The primary goal of the project is to determine the significance of Homomorphic Encryption(HE) and why it is more beneficial to an organisation compared to a traditional encryption. One of Homomorphic Encryption's (HE) capabilities is secure data monetization, which allows data to be processed in a privacy-preserving manner without the risk of exposure. This also allows existing sensitive or regulated data to be used in ways that were previously deemed too risky to pursue. **For example,** if encryption acts as a vault to protect sensitive data, traditional practice calls for that data to be removed from the vault each time it needs to be used or processed. Because of this vulnerability, both the data and the operation are at risk. Whereas, HE allows these actions to take place within the vault, ensuring that the interaction and its outcomes are safe. Most of the homomorphic encryption schemes is based on Ring-Learning With Errors (RLWE) problem which is a complex mathematical problem related to high dimensional lattices. These RLWE problem is currently considered to be secured even against quantum computers.


## Project Findings
This section should talk about the main findings of your project and the key parts that you want to show off.

## Project Media
If you are really keen you can also create a video to demonstrate your project and embed this in the page. An example of a youTube video being embedded is below. You will want to change the width of this to be 100% and put the height as something around 500.
