## Project Description
For the most part, live sports are viewed on a single screen. This model seemed to work before everyone had cellphones, tablets and laptops. Nowadays, people are constantly using second screen devices in their living room while watching television, and in the case of live sports, these devices are often used in conjunction with the broadcast feed. For Formula One, people often enjoy looking at the live telemetry screens alongside the broadcast feed, as well as browsing social media and seeing what people are saying during the course of a session.

We wanted to create a web-based multi-screen experience that can tie together these aspects of watching Formula One, and hopefully be able to apply this technology to the viewing of other live sports in the future.

## Project Findings
So far we've found absolutely nothing because I am immensley far behind schedule and thus haven't had a chance to do any user testing during the two grands prix that have come and gone in this time. Joy.

## Project Media
Might chuck a video of user testing here or something. If we can even do user testing at this point :KEKW:
