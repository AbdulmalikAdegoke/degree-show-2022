## Project Description
A solution to greenhouse automation and environmental control with an intelligent chatbot and weed detection.

## Project Findings
The prototype can control the degree of soil moisture, ventilation and temperature inside a greenhouse while providing a useful intelligent chatbot for the end user to query the state of the greenhouse and override the automated procedures of environmental control. Additionally, the weed detection capabilities of the prototype served as the main pre-emptive measure towards weed control in a greenhouse.
