## Project Description
The final product is an Action-RPG 3D game made for everyone who loves this genre. When a player opens the program, the first thing he sees is the menu to choose a language between Italian and English. After the choice of a language, a new menu appears. In this menu, the player can select one of the different options. Those options are to read the story of the island or the hero or go to the setting menu to see or change various options like commands, sound volume and shadow strength. He can also decide to load the credit scene, play a previously saved game or close the application. Lastly, he can start a new game. If he chooses to play a new game, the game loads the first scene inside the squared city.
For the user interface, three bars are visible at the bottom left of the screen. Those bars show health experience and mana. Near the experience bar, there is the actual player's level. At the bottom right, the player can see the gold in his possession. Whenever the player speaks to an NPC or some events happen that need to show a text box, like when the player opens a chest, chat boxes appear at the top of the screen.
Here the player can explore the city, speak to NPCs and go inside the shop to buy useful items or upgrades.
Leaving the city, the player reaches the open-world area, an island surrounded by the ocean. This open-world area is full of enemies to fight in order to increase the player level and earn gold.
Every time the player increases a level, his mana and health values get restored to their increased max values. Levelling up also unlocks new upgrades to the weapon shop. The player cannot use a weapon higher than his actual level or a shield higher than half of it.
With gold, the player can buy upgrades for his weapon and shield. Buy potions or rest at the inn, which fully recovers his mana and health.
Exploring the open-world area, the player can find two differently shaped cities with the same shops as the first city. He can also find chests containing free potions or gold. To unlock the final area with the boss, the player must open one of those chests located behind the circle city.
Whenever the player is ready, he can travel to the mountains area, which is where he can find the boss.
Hints about the locations of the boss and the chest required to unlock the final area are given to the player when he speaks to villagers.
The game ends when the player defeats the final boss, sending the boss health values to zero or below, or the player's health reaches the value of zero or below.
When the game is over, the player sees a different scene depending on whether he won or lost.
The player can pause the game any time he wants, allowing him to check the inventory and drink potions, change settings or save the game.
Following the hero story, the player should save the island from a demon sealed centuries ago in the mountains, which awakes after a war between three rival gangs, one from each city, broke the seal. The hero is actually the leader of one of those gangs, and he is also the only survivor after the demon wiped out all those gangs.
The developer hopes that players can enjoy a challenging game with a fascinating story.

## Project Findings
This section should talk about the main findings of your project and the key parts that you want to show off.

## Project Media
If you are really keen you can also create a video to demonstrate your project and embed this in the page. An example of a youTube video being embedded is below. You will want to change the width of this to be 100% and put the height as something around 500.
